Your past experience in retail environments can ease your transition since you're already pretty familiar with handling product inquiries and sales scenarios. It's nice to know you'd be stepping into something you're used to. However, keep in mind, the position does involve meeting sales targets, which might be a bit of a challenge if you're not yet comfortable with that aspect. Also, the working hours could sometimes be irregular, which might not always align with your personal schedule preferences. On the plus side, the position offers opportunities to earn a commission, which could boost your earnings if you thrive in a sales-driven environment. Weighing the benefits, like honing your sales skills and interacting with diverse customers, against potential challenges in working hours and sales targets, can help you figure out if this role is the one for you.
